# Tableau Scripts
A series of helper functions and utilities for data professionals who frequently interact with Tableau.

# Setup
`$ git clone {repo_url}` \
`$ cd tableau-scripts` \
â€¢ Assumes you have `pyenv` installed \
`$ pyenv install 3.9.5` \
`$ pyenv virtualenv 3.9.5 tableau-scripts` \
`$ pip install --upgrade pip` \
`$ pip install -r requirements.txt` \
\
Create a duplicate of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`. \
\
Update the `.env` file you just created with your environment variables. \
\
Open project in your favorite IDE. I am partial to PyCharm. Add run configurations for the various scripts and enjoy. \
